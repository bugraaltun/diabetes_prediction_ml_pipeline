## Business Problem
Can you develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified?

## Dataset Story
The dataset is part of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA. It is the data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city of the State of Arizona in the USA. It consists of 768 observations and 8 numerical independent variables. The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.

## Variables
*Pregnancies
*Glucose – 2-hour plasma glucose concentration in the oral glucose tolerance test
*SkinThickness
*Insulin– 2 hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
*Blood Pressure– Blood Pressure (mm Hg)
*DiabetesPedigreeFunction: 2 hour plasma glucose concentration in oral glucose tolerance test
*Age
*Outcome: Have the disease (1) or not (0)
